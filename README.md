# Credit_card_fraud_detection

The goal of this project is to build a binary classifier to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
I have used both machine learning techniques such as Decision trees and random forests as well as deep learning technique to make this model.
Using both these techniques , I was able to achieve high accuracy.
